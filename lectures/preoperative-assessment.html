            <p>The preoperative assessment is a medical check-up and laboratory investigations done before surgery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To assess the patient‚Äôs physical condition and any other medical problems/diseases</li>
                <li>To identify factors that significantly increase the risk of complications, and modify the procedure appropriately</li>
                <li>To identify the appropriate anaesthetic technique to be used</li>
                <li>To ensure safety of perioperative care, optimal resource use, improved outcomes and patient satisfaction</li>
                <li>Several studies have shown that inadequate preoperative preparation of patients may be a major contributory factor to peri-operative catastrophes.</li>
                <li>It is therefore essential that the anaesthetist visits every patient in the ward or the patient is seen in the pre-anaesthetic clinic before surgery to assess fitness for anaesthesia.</li>

                            <h4>Problems of Chronic Cigarette Smoking</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Peripheral, Coronary, and Cerebral Vascular Diseases:</strong> Chronic cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases affecting the peripheral arteries, coronary arteries, and cerebral blood vessels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sympathetic Effects of Nicotine:</strong> Nicotine, a component of cigarettes, has sympathetic effects on the body, leading to conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure) and tachycardia (increased heart rate).</li>
                                <li><strong>Carboxy-Haemoglobin Levels:</strong> Smokers often have elevated levels of carboxy-haemoglobin in their blood. This reduces the amount of hemoglobin available for binding with oxygen, potentially compromising oxygen transport.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hyperactive Airways:</strong> Chronic smoking can result in hyperactive airways, leading to increased postoperative respiratory morbidity. This may manifest as bronchospasm and increased mucus secretion.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h4>Chronic Alcoholics</h4>
                            <p>Chronic alcoholics may present unique challenges in anesthesia:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Increased Tolerance to Anaesthetic Drugs:</strong> Chronic alcoholics often develop increased tolerance to anesthesia medications due to liver enzyme induction. This can make it challenging to achieve the desired anesthetic effects.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hepatic and Cardiac Damage:</strong> Chronic alcoholism can lead to liver and cardiac damage, which may affect the metabolism and distribution of anesthetic agents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Drug Metabolism:</strong> In cases of liver damage associated with chronic alcoholism, the metabolism of drugs may be impaired, potentially affecting their clearance from the body and increasing the risk of drug interactions.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>It's important for anesthesiologists to be aware of these factors when planning and administering anesthesia to patients with a history of chronic cigarette smoking or alcoholism. Tailoring the anesthesia approach to the individual patient's medical history is essential for ensuring safe and effective perioperative care.</p>
                            
                        </div>

                        <h4> Drug History</h4>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>ADRENALINE:</strong> Adrenaline can cause cardiac arrhythmias when used in conjunction with volatile anesthetic agents like halothane.</li>
                            <li><strong>AMINOGLYCOSIDES:</strong> Drugs such as streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamycin, neomycin, and tobramycin may prolong the action of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.</li>
                            <li><strong>BETA BLOCKERS:</strong> Beta blockers like propranolol, atenolol, and oxprenolol have negative inotropic effects on the heart. Caution is required when using cardiovascular depressant agents like halothane and suxamethonium in patients taking beta blockers.</li>
                            <li><strong>DIGOXIN:</strong> Digoxin can lead to cardiac arrhythmias when administered in conjunction with drugs like suxamethonium and halothane.</li>
                            <li><strong>DIURETICS:</strong> Diuretics may cause hypovolemia and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can enhance the action of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.</li>
                            <li><strong>ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS:</strong> These antihypertensive drugs, such as lisinopril and captopril, can lead to severe hypotension following anesthesia induction. They may need to be withdrawn 2-3 days before surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>STEROIDS:</strong> Prolonged steroid therapy (common in conditions like asthma and intracranial tumors) can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, preventing the patient from mounting the necessary stress response to surgery. Patients on long-term steroids should receive a steroid boost in the perioperative period.</li>
                            <li><strong>ANTICOAGULANTS:</strong> Warfarin should be discontinued 5 days before surgery to prevent excessive bleeding.</li>
                            <li><strong>ANTIPLATELETS:</strong> Aspirin (e.g., Vasoprin) should be stopped 5-10 days before surgery to prevent excessive bleeding. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Steps 8 and 9 can also help to prevent epidural hematoma (spinal cord compression) following epidural or spinal anesthesia.</p>
                        

                        <h4>Family History</h4>
                        <p>Family history plays a crucial role in identifying hereditary conditions associated with anaesthetic problems. These conditions must be thoroughly assessed to ensure patient safety:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Haemoglobinopathy</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Porphyria</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Malignant Hyperthermia</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Haemophilia</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Muscular Dystrophies</strong></li>
                        </ol>

                            <p>During the preoperative assessment, a thorough examination of all body systems is essential:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>General Examination:</strong> Check for pallor, cyanosis, jaundice, edema, and ensure easy access for venipuncture.</li>
                                <li><strong>Respiratory System:</strong> Assess for dyspnea and listen to breath sounds.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cardiovascular System:</strong> Check pulse, blood pressure, and heart sounds.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Additionally, assess the ease of tracheal intubation by considering:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Degree of mouth opening</li>
                                <li>Condition of teeth (presence of caries, caps, loose teeth, protruding upper incisors)</li>
                                <li>Degree of flexion of the cervical spine and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h4>Problem Identification - Airway</h4>
                            <p>The assessment of the airway is of utmost importance:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use the Mallampati classification to view oral and pharyngeal structures. Patients sit upright, open their jaw maximally, and protrude their tongue without phonation. Classes I, II, III, and IV indicate increasing difficulty of intubation.</li>
                                <li>Measurements to consider:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Interincisor distance: &lt; 3 cm (indicative of difficult intubation)</li>
                                    <li>Thyromental distance: &lt; 6.5 cm (indicative of difficult intubation)</li>
                                    <li>Sternomental distance: &lt; 12.5 cm (indicative of difficult intubation)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            
                            <h4>Mallampati Classification</h4>
                            <p>The Mallampati Classification is used to assess the visibility of oral and pharyngeal structures, which can help predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Class I:</strong> Soft palate, uvula, anterior, and posterior faucial pillars are visible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Class II:</strong> Soft palate and uvula are visible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Class III:</strong> Soft palate and the base of the uvula are visible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Class IV:</strong> Soft palate is not visible.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>1. <strong>Urinalysis:</strong> Perform on all patients. It's cost-effective and may reveal conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM) or urinary tract infection (UTI).</p>
                            <p>2. <strong>Hemoglobin (Hb) or Hematocrit (PCV):</strong> Recommended for all patients.</p>
                            <p>3. <strong>Serum Electrolytes (E & U):</strong> Required in patients with diarrhea, vomiting, metabolic disease, renal or hepatic issues, and major surgeries. Also, for patients on diuretics, digoxin, antihypertensives, steroids, or hypoglycemic agents.</p>
                            <p>4. <strong>Chest X-ray (CXR):</strong> Recommended for elderly patients and those with respiratory or cardiac diseases.</p>
                            <p>5. <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG):</strong> Essential for patients over 50 years old and those with cardiovascular (CVS) disease or diabetes mellitus (DM).</p>
                            <p>6. <strong>Sickle Cell Status:</strong> Particularly relevant in environments where sickle cell disease is prevalent.</p>
                            <p>7. <strong>Additional tests:</strong> Depending on the patient's history and examination, other tests may be necessary. For example, blood sugar tests for DM or steroid therapy, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, and coagulation screening for liver disease or severe pre-eclampsia.</p>
