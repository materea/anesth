                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Pain, defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, is subjective and influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised its definition in 2020 to emphasize the personal nature of pain and its complex origins.</p>
              
                  <h3>Clinical Terms Associated with Pain</h3>
                  <p>Terms like dysesthesia, allodynia, hyperalgesia, hyperesthesia, hyperpathia, neuralgia, and paresthesia help describe and classify different aspects of pain.</p>
              
                  <h3>Types of Pain</h3>
                  
                  <h4>Acute Pain</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Short-term, usually <3 or 6 months.</li>
                      <li>Has a clear temporal and causal relationship to injury or disease.</li>
                      <li>Examples include postoperative pain, trauma, and procedural pain.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4>Chronic Pain</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Persists beyond the expected period of healing (beyond 3-6 months).</li>
                      <li>Considered a disease in its own right with significant physical, emotional, and environmental impacts.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <h3>Pathophysiology of Pain</h3>
                  <p>Pain involves peripheral receptors, neural pathways, spinal cord mechanisms, brain processing, and descending pathways. Pain mediators, including bradykinin, prostaglandins, and neuropeptides, activate nociceptors, leading to the transmission of pain signals.</p>
              
                  <h3>Assessment of Pain</h3>
                  <p>Accurate assessment involves a comprehensive pain history, physical examination, psychological examination, relevant investigations, and evaluation of associated functional impairment. Various pain measurement tools, including verbal rating scales, numerical rating scales, and visual analogue scales, help in quantifying pain intensity.</p>
              
                  <h3>Treatment of Acute Pain</h3>
                  <p>Treatment goals include stopping or alleviating pain, preventing progression, aiding healing, and restoring normal lifestyle. Pharmacological, non-pharmacological, interventional, and complementary therapies are employed. Multimodal analgesia, using a combination of drugs with different mechanisms, is often preferred.</p>
              
                  <h3>Treatment of Chronic Pain</h3>
                  <p>Chronic pain persists beyond normal tissue healing, impacting various aspects of life. The International Classification of Disease suggests seven categories, including chronic primary pain, chronic cancer pain, chronic post-traumatic pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic headache, and orofacial pain, chronic visceral pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.</p>
              
                  <h3>Epidemiology of Chronic Pain</h3>
                  <p>Prevalence varies globally, with around 20% reported in developed countries. Chronic pain affects all ages, with women and the elderly being over-represented. The true incidence is unknown, and various factors contribute to its complexity.</p>
              
                  <h3>Assessment of Chronic Pain</h3>
                  <p>Measurement relies on the patient's ability to communicate pain verbally and behaviorally. Tools like unidimensional pain scales, visual analogue scales, numerical rating scales, Wong-Baker FACES pain scale, and multidimensional scales like the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory are commonly used.</p>
              
                  <h3>Management of Chronic Pain</h3>
                  <p>A multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving pain management programs that address physical, psychological, and practical aspects. Treatment methods may include medication, physical therapy, psychological interventions, and lifestyle modifications.</p>
              
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>Chronic pain is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive understanding and a multidisciplinary approach for effective diagnosis and management. Pain management programs play a crucial role in empowering patients to manage their pain and improve their quality of life.</p>

            <h4>What is Pain?</h4>
            <p>An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (I.A.S.P, Merskey 1979).</p>
            
            <h4>"Whatever the experiencing person says it is, and exists whenever the person says it does" (McCaffery 1965).</h4>
            <p>A complex and unpleasant phenomenon, indicating some problem, and often causing further physiological, psychological, and social difficulties (Hawthorne and Redmond 1999).</p>
            
            <p>However, this definition has been criticized as ignoring the multiplicity of mind‚Äìbody interactions, and that it neglects the ethical dimensions of pain and does not adequately address pain in disempowered and neglected populations, such as neonates and the elderly.</p>
            
            <p>It was also argued that the definition emphasizes verbal self-report at the expense of nonverbal behaviors that may provide vital information, especially in nonhuman animals and humans with impaired cognition or language skills.</p>
            
            <p>The definition was revised in 2020.</p>
            

            <h4>Revised IASP Definition of Pain (2020)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The following notes were added to further explain the definition:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Pain is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors.</li>
                <li>Pain and nociception are different phenomena; pain cannot be inferred solely from activity in sensory neurons.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Through their life experiences, individuals learn the concept of pain.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A person‚Äôs report of an experience as pain should be respected.</li>
                <li>Although pain usually serves an adaptive role, it may have adverse effects on function and social and psychological well-being.</li>
                <li>Verbal description is only one of several behaviors to express pain; inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that a human or a nonhuman animal experiences pain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Terms Associated with Pain</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dysesthesia:</strong> An unpleasant abnormal sensation, whether spontaneous or evoked.</li>
                <li><strong>Allodynia:</strong> Pain due to a stimulus which does not normally provoke pain, such as pain caused by light touch to the skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperalgesia:</strong> An increased response to a stimulus which is normally painful.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperesthesia:</strong> Increased sensitivity to stimulation, excluding the special senses. Hyperesthesia includes both allodynia and hyperalgesia, but the more specific terms should be used wherever they are applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperpathia:</strong> Presence of hyperaesthesia, allodynia, and hyperalgesia usually associated with overreaction and persistence of sensation after stimuli.</li>
                <li><strong>Neuralgia:</strong> Pain in the distribution pathway of a nerve or group of nerves.</li>
                <li><strong>Paraesthesia:</strong> Abnormal sensation perceived without apparent stimulus.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Pain is a major healthcare problem. Common in all age groups ‚Äì including newborn.</p>
            <p>Is no respecter of person, not discriminating on the basis of gender or race.</p>
            <p>Only the sufferer can decide what hurts and how much.</p>

          <p>Acute pain can be defined as having been present for a short period of time (typically &lt;3 or 6 months). It usually has an identifiable temporal and causal relationship to injury or disease.</p>
          <p>Acute pain serves a protective function and promotes survival. Thus much of modern medical practice focuses on reducing or blocking the acute pain response to improve patient comfort and promote well-being.</p>
          
          <h4>Examples of Acute Pain</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Pain due to traumatic injuries</li>
              <li>Burns pain</li>

              <li>Postoperative pain</li>
              <li>Some cancer pain</li>
              <li>Procedural pain</li>
              <li>Acute headaches</li>

          </ul>
          
          <h4>Classification of Pain</h4>

          <p>Pain is classified as:</p>
          
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <strong>Nociceptive:</strong> Caused by tissue damage:

              <h4> Pathophysiology of Pain</h4>

              <p>Pain is a complex phenomenon that involves a delicate interplay between various components of the nervous system. To understand it fully, we need to break down the different stages of pain processing, starting from the periphery and ending in the brain.</p>
              
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Peripheral Receptors:</strong>
                      <p>These are specialized nerve endings located throughout the body that detect potentially damaging stimuli. There are two main types of pain receptors:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Nociceptors: These respond to noxious stimuli like heat, cold, pressure, and chemicals. They can be further divided into:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>A-delta fibers: Responsible for fast, sharp pain.</li>
                                  <li>C-fibers: Responsible for slow, burning pain.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Mechanoreceptors: These respond to non-painful mechanical stimuli like touch, pressure, and vibration.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li><strong>Neural Pathways:</strong>
                      <p>Once a nociceptor is activated, it sends an electrical signal along a sensory nerve fiber towards the spinal cord. The type of fiber determines the speed and quality of the pain signal:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>A-delta fibers: Transmit signals quickly, resulting in the first sharp pain sensation.</li>
                          <li>C-fibers: Transmit signals slowly, contributing to the dull, burning pain sensation.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li><strong>Spinal Cord Mechanisms & Long Tracts:</strong>
                      <p>The sensory nerve fibers carrying the pain signal enter the spinal cord through the dorsal root ganglia. Here, the signals are processed and modulated by various interneurons before being transmitted to the brain via ascending long tracts:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Spinothalamic tract: This tract transmits the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain, including location, intensity, and duration.</li>
                          <li>Spinoreticular tract: This tract transmits the emotional-motivational aspects of pain, including the unpleasantness and the urge to withdraw from the painful stimulus.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              
                  <li><strong>Brainstem, Thalamus, Cortex & Other Areas:</strong>
                      <p>The ascending tracts terminate in various brain regions, each playing a role in the perception of pain:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Brainstem: This region is involved in the initial processing of pain signals and the activation of descending pain control pathways.</li>
                          <li>Thalamus: This acts as a relay station, directing pain signals to the cortex for further processing.</li>
                          <li>Cortex: This is where the conscious perception of pain occurs. Different areas of the cortex are responsible for different aspects of pain, including sensory-discriminative (location and intensity), emotional-motivational (unpleasantness and suffering), and cognitive-evaluative (interpretation and meaning of pain).</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              
                  <li><strong>Descending Pathways:</strong>
                      <p>The brain also sends signals back down the spinal cord via descending pathways to modulate pain perception. These pathways can inhibit pain signals at the level of the spinal cord, thereby reducing the intensity of pain perceived.</p>
                  </li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4>Mechanism of Pain Generation</h4>

              <p>Tissue damage results in the following:</p>
              
              <ol>
                  <li>Release of algogens (pain-causing substances).</li>
                  <li>The algogens bathe and stimulate/sensitize the nerve endings of small myelinated or unmyelinated fibers (nociceptors).</li>
                  <li>The nociceptors transmit the signal into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (nociception).</li>
                  <li>The signal is then projected into specific areas of the brain.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4>Pain Mediators</h4>

              <p>Pain mediators activate and sensitize nociceptors. They include:</p>
              
              <ul>
                  <li>Bradykinin</li>
                  <li>Prostaglandins</li>
                  <li>Histamine</li>
                  <li>Serotonin</li>
                  <li>Potassium</li>
                  <li>Protons</li>
                  <li>Cytokinin</li>
                  <li>Neuropeptides, such as substance P.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Peripheral Nociceptors</h4>

              <p>Nociceptive afferents are widely distributed in the body (skin, muscle, joints, viscera, meninges) and comprise both medium-diameter lightly myelinated A-delta fibers and small-diameter, slow-conducting unmyelinated C-fibers.</p>
              <p>The most numerous subclass of nociceptor is the C-fiber polymodal nociceptor, which responds to a broad range of physical (heat, cold, pressure) and chemical stimuli.</p>
              
              <h4>Peripheral Pain Fibres</h4>
              
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>C Fibres:</strong> Small non-myelinated fibers from nociceptors in the skin and viscera, transmit pain due to thermal, mechanical, and chemical damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>AŒ¥ Fibres:</strong> Small myelinated fibers respond to pin-prick and acupuncture; strong stimulation causes the sensation of pain.</li>
                  <li><strong>AŒ≤ Fibres:</strong> Larger myelinated fibers carry impulses from mechanoreceptors which modulate pain sensation.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Central Projections of Pain Pathways</h4>

              <p>The spinothalamic pathway ascends from primary afferent terminals in laminae I and II, via connections in lamina V of the dorsal horn, to the thalamus and then to the somatosensory cortex.</p>
              <p>This pathway provides information on the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain (i.e., the site and type of painful stimulus).</p>
              
              <p>The spinoreticular (spinoparabrachial) and spinomesencephalic tracts project to the medulla and brainstem and are important for integrating nociceptive information with arousal, homeostatic and autonomic responses, as well as projecting to central areas mediating the emotional or affective component of pain.</p>

            <h4>Sensory Neuron Order in Pain Perception</h4>
            <h5>First Order Neuron</h5>

            <p>The cell body of the first-order neuron lies in a dorsal root ganglion or a somatic afferent ganglion of cranial nerves.</p>
            
            <h5>Second Order Neuron</h5>
            
            <p>The cell body of the second-order neuron lies within the spinal cord or brain stem. Examples are dorsal column nuclei.</p>
            <p>These cells usually decussate or terminate in the thalamus.</p>
            
            <h5>Third Order Neuron</h5>
            
            <p>The cell body of the third-order neuron, which lies in the thalamus, projects to the sensory cortex.</p>
            <p>In the cortex, information is processed. They interpret location, quality, and intensity of various stimuli and make appropriate responses.</p>
            
              
            <h4>Sensory Pathways</h4>

            <p><strong>Lemniscal/Dorsal Column:</strong> Carries touch, joint sensation, two-point discrimination, and vibratory senses from the receptors to the cortex.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ventrolateral System:</strong> Relays impulses concerning nociceptive stimuli (pain, crude touch) or changes in skin temperature.</p>

          <h4>Pain Measurement</h4>

          <p><strong>Why do we need to measure pain?</strong></p>
          
          <ol>
              <li>Need to compare a single patient and a group of patients</li>
              <li>To monitor the progress of individual patients.</li>
              <li>To validate new treatments for research purposes.</li>
              <li>To provide a means of assessing the efficacy of and response to analgesic.</li>
              <li>Assigning a measure to the patient‚Äôs painful experience over time gives the patients some sense of control over his/her condition and has a positive effect on coping strategies.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Key Points about Pain Assessment</h4>

          <ul>
              <li>Pain is a subjective experience.</li>
              <li>Can be perceived directly only by the sufferer.</li>
              <li>Observer-generated assessment is not reliable.</li>
              <li>Clinical standard for assessment is a self-report scale.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>First step in the recognition and treatment of pain.</strong></p>
          <p>Should be assessed routinely alongside other vital signs, and intervention given and modified as clinical situation demands.</p>
          <p>Should be assessed both at rest and during activity.</p>
          <p>Clinical standard for assessment is a self-report scale (The Royal College of Surgeons and College of Anaesthetists 1990).</p>
          
          <h4>Single-Dimension Pain Instruments</h4>

          <ul>
              <li>Rely on a single aspect of the pain experience, such as physical (intensity), functional, or behavioral.</li>
              <li>Simple and quick to administer.</li>
              <li>Good for bedside assessment.</li>
              <li>Methods vary from descriptive terms to visual analogue scales.</li>
              <li>Categorical scales have the advantage of being quick and simple and may be useful in the elderly or visually impaired patient and in some children. However, the limited number of choices in categorical compared with numerical scales may make it more difficult to detect differences between treatments.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <ol>
              <li>Verbal Rating Scale</li>
              <li>Numerical Rating Scale</li>
              <li>Visual Analogue Scale
                  <ul>
                      <li>They are the most widely used pain rating scales.</li>
                      <li>Used both in clinical practice and research.</li>
                      <li>They are simple, minimally intrusive, effective, and easy to administer and score.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Verbal Rating Scale for Pain</h4>

          <p>
              <strong>Stratifies pain intensity according to levels of severity.</strong>
              It employs different word descriptions to rate the patient‚Äôs pain, e.g., no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, worst possible pain.
              These words can be translated to any language.
              Numbers can be assigned to each of these words for recording purposes.

          <h4>Verbal Numerical Rating Scales (VNRS)</h4>

          <p>
              <strong>Numerical Rating Scales (NRS)</strong> have both written and verbal forms.
              Patients rate their pain intensity on the scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents ‚Äòno pain‚Äô and 10 represents ‚Äòworst pain imaginable‚Äô.
              It is assumed that each number represents a proportional increase in pain severity.
          </p>

            <h4>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</h4>

            <p>
                <strong>This employs a 10 cm line</strong> rated from ‚Äúno pain‚Äù at the left to ‚Äúworst pain‚Äù possible on the right.
                It requires the patients to mark their pain on the continuum.
                The VAS ‚Äúscore‚Äù is the distance from the ‚Äúno pain‚Äù point to the patient‚Äôs estimate.
                There should be no markings on, numbers, or words along the line, as these tend to influence the results.

            <p>
              <strong>VAS are the most commonly used scales for rating pain intensity in research,</strong> with the words ‚Äòno pain‚Äô at the left end and ‚Äòworst pain imaginable‚Äô at the right.
              Pictorial versions also exist. VAS can also be used to measure other aspects of the pain experience (e.g., affective components, patient satisfaction, side effects).
          </p>
          <p>
              These scales have the advantage of being simple and quick to use, allow for a wide choice of ratings, and avoid imprecise descriptive terms.
              However, the scales require more concentration and coordination, need physical devices,
              are unsuitable for children under 5 years and may also be unsuitable in up to 26% of adult patients.

          <h4>Pain Measurement in Children</h4>

          <ul>
              <li>Because children have difficulty in communicating their pain, it can go unrecognized and untreated.</li>
              <li>Measurement is complicated by age and development of the child and his/her interaction with the parents.</li>
              <li>It is the child's behavior often, rather than their verbal report, which has to be interpreted to determine if they have pain.</li>
              <li>Infants with no verbal skills use non-specific measures of general distress like crying or motor withdrawal.</li>
              <li>Toddlers - these have begun to develop localizing and other signs which are more indicative of pain, such as rubbing, as well as more complex although less specific behaviors such as lip smacking, and aggressive behaviors.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
              Designed for children 3 years of age and older, is useful in patients with whom communication may be difficult.
              The patient is asked to point to various facial expressions ranging from a smiling face (no pain) to an extremely unhappy one that expresses the worst possible pain.
          </p>

            <h4>Local Anaesthetics</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Interrupt pain pathways by blocking axonal conduction.</li>
                <li>There are many straightforward L.A. techniques which can be used for acute pain management.</li>
                <li>Regional blocks include intrathecal and epidural.</li>
                <li>Local infiltration with long-acting L.A.</li>
                <li>Specific nerve blocks.</li>

    <li>Distraction</li>
    <li>Auricular Electrical Stimulation</li>
    <li>Therapeutic Touch Techniques</li>
</ul>

<h4>Psychological Interventions</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The role of psychological interventions in the management of acute pain is generally seen as adjunctive to somatic modalities.</li>
    <li>Evidence for the value of their contribution is strengthening.</li>
    <li>Preparatory information has been found to be effective in improving postoperative recovery and reducing pain reports, pain medication use, and length of hospital stay.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Preventive Analgesia</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The pain pathway is a tinderbox. Once in flames, it is difficult to put out.</li>
    <li>As the pain pathways become sensitized, the amount of medication needed to control patient pain increases.</li>
    <li>Intervening before the pain system becomes sensitized is an absolute necessity when your goal is optimal patient benefit.</li>
    <li>Pain management is most effective when instituted prior to the painful event.</li>

              </ol>
              <h4>Epidemiology of Chronic Pain</h4>

              <ul>
                  <li>It is often reported that the prevalence of self-reported chronic pain in the adult general population is approximately 20% in developed countries.</li>
                  <li>All ages are affected, with women and the elderly being over-represented.</li>
                  <li>However, there have been few population-based surveys conducted in developing countries.</li>
                  <li>In 2008, Smith and Torrance estimated the mean worldwide prevalence as 22.9%, with Nigeria having about 5.5%.</li>
                  <li>Incidence of cancer pain is said to be 73.8% in Ibadan Nigeria, according to a study by UCH.</li>
                  <li>In 2013, G. Jimoh et al. showed a prevalence of 55.4% of low back pain among pregnant women in 3 facilities in Ilorin.</li>
                  <li>It is also estimated that 7% of the population suffer chronic pain at any point in time.</li>
                  <li>Back pain represents the largest group in most surveys and is the main reason for 20% of all visits to a GP.</li>
                  <li>It is also the cause for 45 million certified days off work annually.</li>
                  <li>The true incidence of chronic pain is unknown.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Classification of Chronic Pain</h4>

              <ul>
                  <li>Somatic Pain</li>
                  <li>Visceral Pain</li>
                  <li>Neuropathic Pain</li>
                  <li>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</h4>

              <p>
                  Also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy or sympathetically maintained pain.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  Apart from pain, the patients may have a smooth, shiny, sweaty skin with a mottled appearance, muscle wasting, soft tissue swelling, and localized osteoporosis.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  Regional block of the sympathetic nervous system can produce significant relief.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  This is achieved through lumbar sympathetic block, stellate ganglion block, and intravenous regional technique with guanethidine.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Assessment of Chronic Pain</h4>

              <p>
                  Measurement of chronic pain is essential for the study of pain treatments.
                  It is important to be able to evaluate and quantify the outcomes of various pain therapies and interventions.
                  There is no objective measure of chronic pain; evaluation relies on the patient‚Äôs ability to communicate their pain both verbally and behaviorally.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  <strong>Commonly used pain assessment tools:</strong>
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                  <li>Unidimensional pain scales</li>
                  <li>Visual analogue scales (VAS)</li>
                  <li>Numerical rating scales (NRS)</li>
                  <li>Wong-Baker FACES pain scale</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Multidimensional Pain Scales</h4>

              <p>
                  <strong>McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  The MPQ is a checklist of words describing symptoms. 
                  Unlike other pain rating methods that assume pain is one-dimensional and describe intensity but not quality,
                  it aims to define pain in three major dimensions:
              </p>
              
              <ol>
                  <li>Sensory-discriminative (nociceptive pathways)</li>
                  <li>Motivational-affective (reticular and limbic structures)</li>
                  <li>Cognitive-evaluative (cerebral cortex)</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>
                  Contains 20 sets of descriptive words divided into 4 major groups:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                  <li>10 sensory</li>
                  <li>5 affective</li>
                  <li>1 evaluative</li>
                  <li>4 miscellaneous</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                The patient selects the sets that apply to his or her pain and circles the words that best describe the pain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pain rating is derived based on the words chosen.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MPQ is reliable, can be completed in 5-15 minutes, and the choice of words that characterize the pain correlates with pain syndromes and can be useful diagnostically.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its discriminative capacity can be obscured by high levels of anxiety and psychological disturbance.
            </p>


<h4>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Measures intensity, disability, and affect.</li>
    <li>Assesses pain and the subjective impact of pain on activity and functional capability of the patient.</li>
    <li>Short version widely used in pain clinics.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Psychological Evaluation</h4>

<p>The objectives of the psychological evaluation of the patient with chronic pain are to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Determine the degree of psychological adaptation to chronic pain, which includes mood state, coping skills, effect on family, and level of physical functioning;</li>
    <li>Evaluate the patient's premorbid psychological state and personality factors and its effect on onset and etiology of pain;</li>
    <li>Establish the role of psychological factors in the etiology, maintenance, and exacerbation of pain;</li>
    <li>Predict the outcome of invasive procedures such as surgical implantation of spinal cord stimulators or continuous infusion pumps;</li>
    <li>Determine which psychological and medical interventions would be most appropriate for which patients;</li>
    <li>Identify environmental reinforcers of chronic pain and illness behaviors such as family, litigation status, and disability insurance status;</li>
    <li>Evaluate the likelihood of the development of chronic pain-related disability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Psychological Evaluation Tools</h4>

<p>Minnesota Personality Inventory (MMPI)</p>
<ul>
    <li>566 true-false questions that attempt to define the patient's personality on 10 clinical scales</li>
    <li>Includes 3 validity scales which serve to identify patients deliberately trying to hide traits or alter results</li>
    <li>Disadvantages: can be affected by cultural differences, the test is lengthy, some patients find its questions insulting, and it cannot distinguish between organic and functional pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Beck Depression Inventory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Depression is common in patients with chronic pain. This test identifies patients with major depression.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Management of Chronic Pain</h4>

<p>Chronic pain is a complex phenomenon and often multifactorial in etiology. Several methods of treatment may therefore be used in the same patient, either concomitantly or sequentially.</p>

<p><strong>Pain Management Programme:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A pain management programme is a psychologically based rehabilitative treatment for patients with chronic pain which remains unresolved by currently available medical or other physically based treatments.</li>
  <li>The aim of a pain management programme is to reduce the disability and distress caused by chronic pain by teaching sufferers physical, psychological, and practical techniques to improve their quality of life.</li>
  <li>It aims to enable patients to be self-reliant in managing their pain.</li>

  <li>A pain management programme is facilitated by a multidisciplinary health care team.</li>
  <li>Key clinical staff include an anaesthetist, a clinical psychologist, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist, all trained in pain management.</li>
  <li>Information and education about the nature of pain and its management, medication review and advice, psychological assessment and intervention, physical reconditioning, advice on posture, and graded return to the activities of daily living are components of pain management programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chronic pain is a complex phenomenon.</li>
    <li>It can impact every facet of a patient‚Äôs life. Thus the diagnosis and management of patients experiencing chronic pain are critical.</li>
    <li>A multidisciplinary team approach to management is required.</li>
</ul>
