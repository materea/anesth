            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-1'>Introduction</a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>
               The first generation of intravenous (IV) agents for anesthesia induction and maintenance, as an alternative to volatile agents, dates back to the introduction of thiopental in the 1930s.
            </p>
            
            <h4>IV Induction Agents</h4>
            <p>
               IV induction agents are drugs that, when given intravenously in appropriate doses, cause a rapid loss of consciousness. This is often described as occurring within one arm-brain circulation time.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Absorption</h4>
            <p>
               Intravenous injection completely bypasses the process of absorption, as the drug is placed directly into the bloodstream.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Distribution</h4>
            <p>
               Distribution is a major determinant of end-organ drug concentration and depends primarily on several factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Organ perfusion</li>
               <li>Protein binding</li>
               <li>Lipid solubility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               The vessel-rich group, including organs like the brain, liver, heart, kidney, and endocrine glands, takes up a disproportionately large amount of drug compared to the vessel-poor group, which includes structures like bone, ligament, and cartilage. Protein binding plays a crucial role; the higher the protein binding property, the lower the uptake of the drug by the tissue, regardless of organ perfusion. However, the availability of a drug to a specific organ does not ensure uptake, as it must permeate through the membrane first.
            </p>
            
            <h4>History of IV Induction Drugs</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Intravenous anesthesia followed the invention of the hypodermic syringe in 1855.</li>
               <li>In 1932, Wesse and Schrapff reported the use of the first rapidly acting IV drug, hexobarbitone.</li>
               <li>In 1934, Lundy and Waters introduced sodium thiopental into clinical practice.</li>
            </ul>

               <li>Benzodiazepines:
                  <ul>
                     <li>diazepam</li>
                     <li>midazolam</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Opioids:
                  <ul>
                     <li>fentanyl</li>
                     <li>alfentanyl</li>

            <h4>Based on Onset of Action</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Ultra short-acting: propofol, thiopentone, propanidid.</li>
               <li>Moderately acting: etomidate, althesin</li>
               <li>Slower acting: ketamine, benzodiazepines</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Pharmacology</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Painless on injection- propofol, for example, is known to cause pain on injection; fentanyl is usually given before it.</li>
               <li>Thrombophlebitis is rare</li>
               <li>Harmless if injected intra-arterially (or extravasated)- thiopentone can be harmful if given intra-arterially.</li>
               <li>Low incidence of adverse reactions</li>
               <li>Rapid induction of anesthesia- barbiturates like thiopental have a slower induction compared to other agents like propofol.</li>
               <li>Good anti-emetic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant properties - propofol has unique anti-emetic properties; ketamine has analgesic properties; thiopentone has some anticonvulsant properties.</li>
               <li>'Inert' cardiorespiratory effects:
                  <ul>
                     <li>No respiratory depression</li>
                     <li>No bronchoconstriction</li>
                     <li>No myocardial depression</li>
                     <li>No vasoconstriction or dilation</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Predictable (dose-related) recovery and short duration of action</li>
               <li>Inert metabolites</li>
               <li>No adverse effects on kidneys, liver, or metabolism- etomidate can cause adrenal suppression if used for a long time.</li>
               <li>No drug interactions</li>
               <li>No teratogenesis</li>
               <li>Safe during breastfeeding</li>
               <li>No 'emergence phenomena' or 'hangover effect'</li>

                      <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> Etomidate is metabolized by hepatic enzymes and plasma esterases.</li>
                      <li><strong>Excretion:</strong> About 75% of the drug is excreted in the urine, and 13% is eliminated in the feces within the first 24 hours after administration.</li>
                      <li><strong>Clearance:</strong> Etomidate has a clearance rate approximately 6 times greater than thiopental.</li>
                      <li><strong>Induction Dose:</strong> The typical induction dose of etomidate is 0.3 mg/kg.</li>

                        <li><strong>CNS Effects:</strong> Etomidate results in a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and intracranial pressure (ICP).</li>
                        <li><strong>Incidence of Nausea and Vomiting:</strong> Etomidate is associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting (N and V).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiovascular Effects:</strong> It has minimal effects on healthy patients and those with cardiac disease. There are no significant changes in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), or cardiac output (CO), but it decreases mean arterial pressure (MAP).</li>
                        <li><strong>Suitability:</strong> Etomidate is suitable for patients with hypotension, hypovolemia, and cardiovascular disorders due to its minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respiratory Effects:</strong> It reduces tidal volume (TV) by 26% and minute ventilation (MV) but increases respiratory rate (RR). Transient apnea, especially in adults, may occur.</li>

                      <li><strong>pH-Dependent Properties:</strong> The opening of the benzodiazepine ring in Midazolam is pH-dependent and occurs below a pH of approximately 4.0. This pH-dependent behavior leads to increased lipid solubility at physiological pH levels.</li>
                      <li><strong>Onset of Action:</strong> Midazolam typically has an onset of action within 67 to 72 seconds.</li>
                      <li><strong>Respiratory Depression:</strong> Midazolam is associated with minimal respiratory depression.</li>
                      <li><strong>No Hangover Effects:</strong> One notable advantage of Midazolam is that it does not produce hangover effects.</li>
                      <li><strong>Elimination Half-Life:</strong> The elimination half-life of Midazolam ranges from 2 to 2.5 hours.</li>
                      <li><strong>Cardiovascular Stability:</strong> Midazolam is considered cardiostable as it reduces venous return, causes mild myocardial depression, and lowers systemic vascular resistance (SVR) by 15 to 33%.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>Reasons for Co-induction</h4>
            <p>There are several reasons for utilizing co-induction techniques:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduction in Doses: Co-induction allows for the use of lower doses of individual drugs, which can be advantageous.</li>
              <li>Less Side Effects: By combining drugs, it's possible to minimize the occurrence of side effects associated with a single drug.</li>
              <li>Good Clinical Results: Co-induction can lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall effectiveness in achieving anesthesia.</li>

            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-7'> Newer IV Induction Agents</a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>Advancements in intravenous (IV) induction agents have led to the development of newer options. These include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Midazolam Derivatives</li>
                <li>Etomidate Derivatives</li>
                <li>Propofol Analogues and Alternatives</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Midazolam Derivatives</h4>
            <p>Recent developments have led to the creation of midazolam derivatives, such as:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remimazolam:</strong> Remimazolam is a novel, short-acting anesthetic agent. It is ester-based and is characterized by rapid esterase-mediated metabolism. What makes it unique is that it does not rely on hepatic or renal enzymes and function for its breakdown.</li>
                <li><strong>AVD 6209:</strong> AVD 6209 represents a new formulation of oral midazolam, expanding the options for this well-known drug.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Etomidate Derivatives</h4>
            <p>Researchers have also explored derivatives of etomidate, such as:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carboetomidate:</strong> This analogue of etomidate is designed to avoid inhibiting steroid production.</li>
                <li><strong>MOC-Carboetomidate:</strong> Combining the rapid metabolism of MOC-etomidate with the minimal adrenal suppression of carboetomidate, this compound offers an interesting combination of features.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclopropyl-Methoxycarbonyl Metomidate (CPMM or ABP-700):</strong> CPMM is a second-generation etomidate with unique properties. It acts as a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Animal studies have shown promising pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Notably, it exhibits high potency and induces hypnosis that reverses within several minutes after discontinuation of continuous infusions lasting up to 2 hours.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>New Propofol Formulations</h4>
            <p>Recent advancements in propofol formulations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2,6-Disubstituted Alkylphenols (Haisco HSK3486):</strong> These modifications of propofol show promise as anesthetic agents.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Propofol Alternatives</h4>
            <p>There are also alternatives to propofol, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AZD-3043 (AstraZeneca US, Wilmington, DE, USA):</strong> This water-insoluble drug is formulated in an oil emulsion, similar to propofol. In rat studies, AZD-3043 has demonstrated rapid-onset hypnosis and quick recovery, with effects seen within 3 minutes of discontinuing infusions ranging from 20 minutes to 5 hours.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Eltanolone</h4>
            <p>Eltanolone is another noteworthy option:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metabolite of Pregnanolone:</strong> Eltanolone is a metabolite of pregnanolone and functions through the GABA receptor.</li>
                <li><strong>Formulated in a Lipid Emulsion:</strong> It is formulated in a lipid emulsion, and it is known for causing minimal pain upon injection.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Potency:</strong> Eltanolone is 3.1 times more potent than propofol.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Effects:</strong> It results in an increase in heart rate with minimal changes in blood pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Profile:</strong> The recovery time is slightly longer compared to propofol.</li>
                <li><strong>Continued Study:</strong> Alphaxolone, another related compound, is also under study as a potential agent for clinical use.</li>
            </ul>
